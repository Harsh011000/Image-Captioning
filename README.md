# 🖼️ Image Captioning using ResNet50 and LSTM with Attention

This repository contains the code and models for an **Image Captioning** project that generates natural language descriptions for images. It leverages a combination of **ResNet50** for image feature extraction and an **LSTM** network with an attention mechanism for generating captions.

## 🔍 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to generate accurate and context-aware captions for images. To achieve this, the model learns the relationship between image features and the sequence of words that form a caption. The **Flickr8k dataset** was used for training and evaluation.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Image Feature Extraction**:
   - Uses a pretrained **ResNet50** model to extract high-level features from input images.
   - These features represent the spatial and semantic content of the image.

2. **Caption Generation**:
   - An **LSTM** network is trained on the captions from the dataset.
   - An **attention mechanism** is applied between the image features and each step of the sequence to focus on relevant parts of the image when generating each word.

3. **Training**:
   - Implemented in **TensorFlow**.
   - Key notebooks:
     - `preprocessing train data.ipynb`: Handles loading, cleaning, and vectorizing image captions.
     - `model training.ipynb`: Contains the architecture and training loop for the model.

4. **Deployment**:
   - The model is deployed on **Hugging Face Spaces** for interactive inference.
   - You can upload an image and receive a caption generated by the trained model.
